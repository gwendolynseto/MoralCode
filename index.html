    <h2>Examining the past: case studies of tech ethics & computing disasters</h2>
    <p>The best way to prepare for the future–especially in a world where we are increasingly relying on technology–is to learn from the past, especially in cases where we have made harmful mistakes. By thinking about some of the decisions that we have made, and repercussions from our actions, this can guide how we think about tech ethics in the future.</p>

    <h1>Therac-25 disaster</h1>
    <p>In the 1980s, a software-controlled radiation therapy machine known as Therac-25 overdosed patients, leading to injuries and deaths. Because there were no error-checking features, the machine was not checked to make sure that it was operating properly.</p>

    <h1>Knight Capital Group Disaster</h1>
    <p>Due to an issue in the new code of their trading software systems, the financial trading firm’s computers rapidly bought and sold millions of shares for about 45 minutes. This led to artificially inflated stock prices of many different companies, and losses occurred when the algorithm sold these overvalued stocks at a low price.</p>

    <p>The orbiter was designed to study Mars, but was unsuccessful due to some of the teams using the imperial units and some of the teams using metric. Because they used different units of measurement, the software controlling its thrusters was programmed incorrectly, and the spacecraft burned up in Mars’ atmosphere.</p>

    <h1>The Morris Worm</h1>
    <p>In 1988, Robert T. Morris, Jr. created one of the oldest computer worms distributed through the internet. The worm was able to exploit weak passwords, delay emails, and was designed to stay hidden. The worm copied itself 14% of the time, even if the computer was already infected. As a result, some computers were infected multiple times, leading to it slowing down to the point of becoming unusable. It rapidly spread to thousands of machines.</p>

  <h1>Examining the future: ethical frameworks applied to AI</h1>
  <p>Ethical frameworks are perspectives that allow for deciding which actions provide the most moral outcome, or deciding why things are considered “right” versus “wrong”. There are many different ethical frameworks, and these can vary by culture and societal norms that people grow up in. Two ethical frameworks, which are focused on here, include deontology and utilitarianism.</p>
  <p>Deontology: focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions, rather than the consequences of actions</p>
  <p>Utilitarianism: focuses on the rightness of actions depending on if they benefit the majority</p>
  <p>A good example to compare the two would be the classic Trolley Problem. A deontologist would not do anything, because pulling the lever would hurt a person, which would be inherently wrong. On the other hand, a utilitarian would focus on the overall net outcome, and would pull the lever, because losing the life of one person is better than losing the lives of five people.</p>
  <p>Here, case studies of ethical scenarios with AI will be presented. Choose the framework that you resonate most with, and at the end we will see if your ethical framework is more deontologist or utilitarian!</p>
